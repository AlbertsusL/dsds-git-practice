# dsds-git-practice

This repository is mainly for practice with git. Before you begin, you'll need access to the repository.

Don't worry about breaking anything here. There's nothing really valuable in terms of data. Even if you do delete
something, there's a high chance we can get it back (although it might be painful), since git is *awesome*.
